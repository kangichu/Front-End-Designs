						<h2>Collectively Digital. Completely Integrated.</h2>
							<ol>
								<li><h1>Digital Strategy</h1></li>

All these work in tandem to maximize SEO value and Dotsavvy would leverage these for you as a client.</p>

								<li><h1>Mobile Apps</h1></li>
									<p>To say that Africa is mobile-driven is a major understatement. Mobile phones are the only device that gets everyone communicating, transacting and online by the masses. Africa has close to a billion active mobile subscribers as of this writing, and growing. It is the one device that the majority of Internet users in Africa use to get online, most of the time.</p>

									<p>The reality is that mobile as a business channel is core to any digital strategy in Africa. It’s certainly not all about bright and shiny mobile apps, and the team at Dotsavvy can help you navigate the mobile landscape. Whether its building your mobile apps, running a mobile marketing campaign on multiple channels or “mobilizing” legacy business apps, the team at Dotsavvy can help you win.</p>

								<li><h1>Social Media</h1></li>
									<p>Social media has literally set Africa on fire with digital conversations.

This is everything from integrating a content management system (CMS) in your corporate website, deploying an analytics-supported digital marketing campaign, ‘mobilising’ legacy business apps, and everything else in between.</p>

									<p>Our goal at Dotsavvy is not to make you learn all the details of business apps we use but rather to make sure that they work for you in meeting your customers and business needs. We can help you build, customise or extend rich, user-driven business apps for even the most complex business use cases.</p>

								<li><h1>Digital Copywriting</h1></li>

It involves translating business goals to the technology and design sectors, and making sure the business is what drives the features and design of a digital initiate. It is also understanding technology constraints to business and design sectors, and keeping the design and business goals aware of the technical realities. Lastly, it communicates design ideas to the business and technology sectors, and ensuring that functional and aesthetic priorities are managed. This collective convergence is UX Design and ultimately it ensures that Dotsavvy can deliver digital solutions that are user-centric for your brand or business.</p>

						    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
								<p>Dotsavvy is Kenya’s first digital business agency that provides integrated digital business solutions to some of Africa’s biggest businesses and most loved brands. We are driven by the challenge of reconciling our clients user needs and business goals to achieve transformational digital business outcomes. We are more than a digital marketing agency, we are an agent for change for progressive businesses and brands that want to disrupt the status quo by using digital at the heart of their business strategies.

								Dotsavvy started in early 2002 as one of Kenya’s and East Africa’s first website design agencies. From humble beginnings, Dotsavvy’s origins are typical of a startup from any part of the world – a sales guy, a techie, a big idea, zero funding and lots of passion to ‘change the world’ by building the best websites at a time when the Internet was truly nascent in Kenya. Audacious? Absolutely! Since then, much has changed but our commitment to building the most radical digital offerings has never wavered.

								Going forward, mobile is core to ALL digital engagements for businesses and consumers alike throughout the African continent. Social media has become the currency of conversations that can make or break brands. Converging digital platforms are leading to integrated ecosystems that are transforming business as we know it. Its a brand new and bold digital world out there and Dotsavvy is able to help you successfully navigate it. Fly with us, lets soar!</p>

							<h1>What We Believe</h1>
								<p>
									Everything. Digital Is Everything.
									Digital is more than simply a marketing channel as some would have you believe. Digital can be the source of brand and organisational transformation in a myriad of ways – whether its streamlining your mobile platforms, rejuvenating your customer engagements or boosting sales from performance-driven campaigns, digital can sit at the heart of your game-changing business strategies.

									This is what we believe at Dotsavvy, and has inspired the work we do for our clients for over a decade in Kenya, East Africa and beyond. This is what drives us – to make real our clients digital dreams through our amazingly capable and experienced team, as well as our world-class digital business offerings. At Dotsavvy, we are pure digital passion, expressed.
								</p>
								
							<h1>How We Work</h1>
								
								<p>
									Its About Results. Its Iterative. It Works.

									To make digital work for your business, your brands, and your customers, it is essential to start by understanding at a fundamental level ‘why’. Digital is like a swiss army knife – it has so many ways it can be used so its important to know what you want to use it for first, before you even get started. At Dotsavvy, when it comes to doing digital right, we know what works and doesn’t work. In a nutshell, this is how we work with you to deliver your digital dreams:

								</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Define</li>
										<p>It all starts with getting an in-depth understanding of where you are today as a business and where you want to go – assuming no constraints exist. This forms the basis for us coming up with game changing digital strategies that do not conform to the convention but completely dismantle it. This is what is needed to achieve distinction in digital business</p>

										<li>Plan</li>
										<p>Our second step requires us to develop the business objectives for your digital strategies that we will collaboratively articulate with you. These objectives are linked to performance metrics that will aim to achieve (or exceed) through the implementation of the digital strategies developed.</p>

										<li>Build</li>
										<p>Our third step requires us to define specific tactics within the digital strategies developed. This means looking at digital channels and platforms so as to find the right ‘fit’ that will deliver the promise, so to speak. This informs the ‘how’ since we now know the ‘what’. We build what is needed. We design compelling user experiences. We build or customize technologies. We integrate. We test. 
										We make it work for you.</p>

										<li>Deploy</li>
										<p>Our fourth step is when we actually roll-out the various digital initiatives that we determined from the digital strategies and business objectives. This can be anything from launching a mobile app, realigning a corporate website, producing an online video to running a digital ad campaign – we do whatever is required to get you the desired results in the most practical and high impact way possible.</p>

										<li>Measure</li>
										<p>The fifth and final step is where we analyse the performance of the digital initiatives we implemented for you in-line with the digital strategies and measurable business objectives we defined at the start. This enables us to optimise your digital business performance to achieve or exceed the desired outcomes based on the plan we developed at the start.</p>
									</ol>
								
							<h1>Digital Business Quadrant (DBQ)</h1>
								<p>
									In our experience, for any digital initiative to be successful, it MUST conform to what we call the Digital Business Quadrant or DBQ. The DBQ is simple. It dictates that a digital business solution must meet one or more of the following criteria:
								</p>
									<ul style="list-style-type:square">
										<p><li>Generate Sales</li></p>
										<p><li>Reduce Costs</li></p>
										<p><li>Enhance Service</li></p>
										<p><li>Build Brand</li></p>
									</ul>
									<br />
								<p>
									When we work with our clients on their digital engagements, the DBQ serves as our true north in ensuring we stay on track at all times. The DBQ drives all strategic and tactical rationale from start to finish in ensuring digital outcomes that have a positive impact for our clients.
								</p>

							<h1>Converzio</h1>
								<p>
									Converzio is Dotsavvy’s digital business cycle for client engagements. Converzio is an acronym for the digital business cycle of convergence, conversations and conversions – hence, converzio:
								</p>
									<ul style="list-style-type:square">
										<p><li>Convergence refers to building brand awareness via digital channels.</li></p>
										<p><li>Conversation refers to creating brand engagement with customers and prospects via digital channels.</li></p>
										<p><li>Conversion refers to the realisation of new business from existing and/or prospective customers via digital channels.</li></p>
									</ul>
