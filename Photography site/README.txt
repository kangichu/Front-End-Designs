 I'm in the process of redesigning my personal website using some basic techniques. WIP - only about 45min into it. Still need to add page content.

Splash page disappears after initial viewing, it's not a glitch, I did it to avoid scrolling issues on the sub pages for now. The code is the compiled version, thats why it's a little chunky -- still need to refactor some of it too.
